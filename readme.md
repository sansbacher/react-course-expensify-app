# Expensify App

Based on [The Complete React Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/) on Udemy - by Andrew Mead. EXCEPT that all the modules and packages
are the _latest_ versions (as of early 2021). Also NPM has replaced YARN (mainly due to an odd incompatibility between it and Google Drive).

Code has a LOT of extra comments, meant as documentation for future-me to refer back to. In some cases old code is retained (commented out) in case it could be useful for some other project or to see how things worked before some change. In a few cases a \_SAVE folder contains complete old versions of certain files.

Finally: several post-course challenges have been completed and added, so the final result contains a few additions compared to the final lecture.

The end-result can be viewed [on Heroku](https://sansbacher-expensify-app.herokuapp.com/), with the Database and Auth logins provided by Google Firebase.
